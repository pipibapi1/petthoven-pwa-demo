# About the app
## Progressive Web Apps
### an app is generally a PWA if it:
#### runs over HTTPS (or non-HTTPS "localhost")
#### has a manifest.json file
#### has a service worker
#### is responsive, smooth and "app-like"
### a good PWA will be able to run while offline by caching core assets (HTML, CSS, JS, logos etc.)
